## Overview

![Library logotype](Logo.png)

ScrollKit is a SwiftUI library that adds powerful scroll features, like offset tracking and a header view that stretches & transforms as you pull down, and sticks to the top when you scroll.

ScrollKit works on all major Apple platforms and is designed to be easy to use. It doesn't use the new ScrollView APIs for backwards compatibility reasons, but will eventually do so.
